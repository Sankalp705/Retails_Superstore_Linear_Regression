# Retail_Superstore_Analysis

This project involves the analysis and modeling of a retail superstore dataset. The dataset includes customer and transaction details such as Category, City, Country, Sales, Shipping Cost, and more. The primary goals are:
	1.	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
	2.	Visualize key insights from the data.
	3.	Develop and evaluate predictive models like Linear Regression.

🚀 Features
	1.	Data Preprocessing:
         Handle missing values and duplicates.
         Clean and encode categorical data.
         Scale numerical features for modeling.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis:
         Visualize distributions of key variables (e.g., Sales, Profit).
         Analyze relationships like Sales vs. Profit and Discount vs. Profit.
         Correlation heatmaps for numeric variables.
	3.	Machine Learning:
         Build and evaluate a Linear Regression model for predicting Sales.
         Model evaluation using metrics like MSE and R² Score.
